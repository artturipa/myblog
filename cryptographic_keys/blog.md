## About standards

Standards NIST ISO are constantly competing about attention and they have their own interest in mind. And there are much of happy consultants to help you get certified and take your money. 

Why do you need to follow ISO, there might be a business reason for it, such as if your large enterprise customers require the certificate. 

Another reason might be, that if there is no awareness about current operations, architecture and security practices, implementing a standard might be best option to get some level of comfort and trust in operations.

But if there is no business reason for the standard, do not think that you should follow it completely.
