# Stupid things in workspace configuration 

Note that these notes refer to configurable / UI Builder Workspaces.

## Editing lists

Needs to be done in 
sys_ux_list_menu_config 

## Editing views, list layout and related lists

Just edit the default view in classical UI. However, if the changes are not applied to workspace, check the views in table **sys_ui_list** or **sys_ui_view**.
