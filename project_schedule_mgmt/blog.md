## Setting milestnoes and the usual fallacy
debug is 99% complete half of the time

Coding is 90% complete half of the time

Set specific milestones. So that they can't be tricked.

## Psychological Safety for the team

Try to get the no, not yes. Dig deeper.

Not: "Hey was it so you can do this by Friday"

But rather: "Do you need any help to get this completed, these UI requirements and authentication issues seem tricky"



Tell if going bad so that can be reacted early
