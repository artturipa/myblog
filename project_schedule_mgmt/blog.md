# Keeping the project in schedule

## On setting milestones and the usual fallacy

One will rarely lie about milestone progress, if the milestones are specific and measurable events. However, it is not uncommon that milestones are soft. These scenarios invite self-deception. 

**Examples of Concrete Milestones**
* Specifications signed off by architects
* Every test case is automated
* Start of UAT

**Examples of Fluffy Milestones**
* 25% of work is complete
* System Integration Testing in progress

Without concrete milestones, one is likely to hear that implementation is 80% ready 90% of the time.

## Psychological Safety for the Team

If the team does not feel safe in bringing up the problems, they won't. I believe most of us have experienced where that path leads.

Be happy. Cultivate good mood to your team. Don't let them think everything is dead-serius (_also, on 99.99% of cases it isn't_). Gain the trust from the team, and the team will actually open up about the problems. Then you can help in solving them if required.

When you are asking about work status, try to get "no, we can't do this" out of people. If you pressure your way to the "yes", you won't see the growing problems lurking behind the all good -status reports.

**Don't ask this:** _"Hey was it so that you will finalize this before UAT"_

**But rather:** _"Do you need any help to get this completed, these UI requirements and authentication issues seem tricky_

Of course, you should learn to know the people and their biases. Some of us are optmists and some are pessimists, these people differ on crucial they perceive some problems to be.

## Be Brave

If you find yourself in a role of a project manager, you should aim for timely honest communication. 

It's always bad if status reports turn from bright green to screaming red. To avoid that, communicate the problems when they start to emerge, this way more resources can be allocated if necessary, and you will sleep better. If you start going down the route of hiding problems, there really is no good way out of there. 
 
I am an optimist by nature, and I have lost my share of sleep and weekends due to overpromising and "all good I handle everything" -attitude. I'm sure I'll find myself burning the midnight oil in the future as well, but I'd like to due that by my own choice, not due to poor work management.
