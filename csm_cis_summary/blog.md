# Here again !

Long time no blogging! The reason being lack of time. I am currently solution architect in three simultaneous implementation project, so days tend to be quite hectic.

Not to make my life too easy, I decided to reserve a slot for CSM CIS exam. The exam is in two weeks so I time to start prepping. CIS exams often have questions about specific configurations, such as names of flows or plugins, and hence some studying is needed.

Below are key notes that I recapped for CIS exam.

# CSM recap

## Key Definitions

**CSM Application scope** includes Cases, Accounts, Contacts, Service Contracts and Entitlements, Assets and product models, Service Portals and/or CMS, Knowledge base and reporting

**ServiceNow's industry solutions are built on top of CSM**. Industry solutions include Telco, Financial Services, Healthcare and Public Sector

**Service-aware install base** allows organizations to:
* Model complex products and services with components
* Quickly identify products sold and installed
* Track related operational services and configuration items that affect service health
* View products not yet purchased or deployed by customers

**Service-aware install base entities** include:
* Product Model
* Install Base Item
* Installed product

**Product** is a good or a Service that a company sells to, and supports for their customers.

**Models** are specific versions of items in the environment. Model record allows maintaining information about the specific model ensuring data consistency.

**Model Categories** are part of Product Catalog and they associate CI classes with Asset classes. Model category configuration specifies whether an asset is created from a CI. Model Categories are set to Product Models.

**Product Portfolio** is comprised of all the products an organization has to offer.

**Asset** [alm_asset] is a specific product instance which is purchased / subscribed by a customer. Asset Management is activated when CSM is installed. Five different asset classes are:
* Hardware Assets [alm_hardware]
* Software License Assets [alm_license]
* Consumables [alm_consumable]
* Enterprise Software Assets [alm_application_software]
* Facility Assets [alm_facility]

**Contact** - Member of an external company. Customer user in B2B -model, contact can be related to only one account. They are not able to login into the system unless an user record is associated with them, user record is created automatically. Customer Service Managers and System Administrators can create contacts.

**Customer Service Agents** - Users of the organisation who provide customer service and work with cases. Agents are organised on groups and skilled on specific products.

**Service Management** connects customer service to the rest of the organization, making collaboration about customer issues with other departments easier.

**Tier 3 support agent**  is a person with compherensive knowledge of a particular area

**Customer Service Supervisors and Managers** oversees operations in customer service including service delivery, personel management and escalations

**Business Managers and Executives** is a person responsible for the overall customer service organization

**Business Contributors** sales managers, account managers, etc.

**Core Master Data** is often referenced by the case, includes accounts, contacts, users, products, assets, locations and groups

**Account** stores the Accountâ€™s information, such as name, account number, primary contact, phone number, address, and company website address. 
* Only Customer Service Manager and System Administrators can create accounts.
* Account can have multiple addresses but only one primary address. Primary address is included in **Addresses** related list with Primary set as **true**

**Account Relationship Types** - System Administrator can create additional relationship types. Default relationships are:
* Partner-to-account
* Account-to-account

**Account Hierarchy** allows modeling legal entity structure and their relationships. A relationship can be created by System Administrator or Customer Service Manager. Customer admins are able to view cases, assets and users for all the subsidiaries under their own account.

**Contact Relationships** enable admins and/or managers to add contacts under multiple accounts. Hence, same contact can be associated with multiple accounts.  

**Account Path** - Is automatically generated code which tells the hierarchy of a given account. Max depth is 63 levels.

**Post Case Review**
After resolution of a case, one can trigger post case review to capture details about resolved case, affected assets, root cause, resolution and preventive measures.

**Installed Products** is a class, which connects **Install base items** to **Sold products**

**Agent Whisper** allows users with __awa_manager__-role to join chat conversations and chat privately with the customer service agent.

**Parent/child synchronization** allows one to control the child case behaviour through the parent record. Admins can control which fields cascade. It only goes one level deep and closed/resolved cases are not synced.

**Assignment Workbench** enables customer service managers to assign tasks to agents. Workbench uses configurable criteria such as skills and availability to evaluate agents in a selected group to provide overall ranking. 

**Advanced Work Assignemnt** removes manual routing of work and prevents cherry picking tasks.

**Self Registration** allows contacts to self register via portal by submitting registration request. 

**Unified portals** allow easy configuration of multiple portals with unified look & feel and a unified navigation menu structure.

**Benefits of Proactive Customer Service Operations**
1. Faster resolution time
2. Lower call volume
3. Improved customer experience

**Three Components of Proactive Service operations:**
1. Service monitoring (detect issues)
2. Service-aware install base (identify impacts)
3. Proactive case (Notify customers)

**Three types of outages:**
1. Unplanned outage
2. Planned outage
3. Degradation

**Social Profiles** can be created for an accont, contact or consumer. And they can be created by Customer Service Managers. Social profiles can be associated to Account, Contact and Consumer

**Entitlement** - Defines the support customer receives and supported channels for the customer. Is measured by cases and/or hours. Entitlements can be made of products, assets and/or contracts (cascades to assets covered).

**OOB integrations to other modules**
* ITSM
* PPM 
* FSM
* ITOM

**Key capabilities of PPM Integration**

**Contracts** - Can be associated to sold products.

**Real-time SLAs**

**Service Contract** contracts group together SLAs that relate to a single vendor or customer, as well as the CIs, locations, groups, users, and child contracts that are related to the contract.

**Customer Self Service portal** - Allows customers to view Assets, Orders and Publications

**Openframe** Provides a communication frame for agents for customer calls. It allows CTI capability with multiple telephony service providers.

**Resolution Shaper** - Timeline that is shown in case record. There blue circle represents state change and line represents any other activity than state change. Customers' updates are below, agents updates are above.


## Default Settings
* Flow of states in case is new, open, awaiting info, resolved, closed
* Agents can manually close a case, if resolution code and -notes are filled.
* From case to knowledge article following fields are copied: Short Description, Cause, Close Notes (-> Resolution) 
* Special handling notes can be created via "Form Link" -button or via Special handling notes module.
* Assignment Workbench default configuration uses **Recommendation for Case Assignment** matching rule, which uses three of the four default matching criteria:
    * Availability Today
    * Matching Skills
    * Assigned Cases
    * Not used: Last assigned
* Customer Service Agents are the ones who manage case escalations
* Account escalation manager manages account escalations
* To use Time Recording, following steps need to be taken:
