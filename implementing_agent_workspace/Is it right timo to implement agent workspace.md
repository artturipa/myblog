# Is it right time to implement Agent Workspace

Agent workspace for custom applications is something I have seen being requested by a growing number of customers. 

ServiceNow added the ability to build custom workspaces in Orlando. Even though we have had couple more upgrades since Orlando, Workspace still has its quirks. 

## Be prepared for these
### Limited support for field types. 
Our team encountered this while building a Workspace for managing announcements and knowledge. Translated text -fields were not supported but we wanted them. We had to build a messy workaround as we did not want to back down at that point.
### Look and feel of reports
The drill down does not work out of the box, however there is knowledge article about fixing it. Performance Analytics widgets were not available, but they will be in Quebec. The design and general look was not as smooth as in traditional dashboards, I hope that will improve as well.
### Journal fields???
Apparently it is not possible to add comments field to the form, without it being visible in two different places simultaneously. I do not want to have same field appear twice. However, it is such a no-brainer that I count on ServiceNow to fix it quite fast.

## Not so bad :)

Regardless of the issues mentioned above, I'm excited about Workspaces and I prefer to work with them whenever I have the chance. I'm sure ServiceNow will improve the issues with coming patches and upgrades, so I wouldn't worry about them too much. Before Workspaces building advanced features with traditional UI was always extremely painful. 

## My suggestion
Coming back to the headline's question, is it a good time? It depends. 

If you are starting to build something new, I would suggest to go for Workspace regardless of the mentioned hinderances. Many of the new platform features are available only through Workspace, and might want to incorporate those into your application.

But if on you do not have a lot of development ongoing, it does not hurt to wait a bit longer.
