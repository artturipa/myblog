# What CSDM aims to be

CSDM (Common Serice Data Model) is a standard data model by ServiceNow, which provides guidance on how service related data should be stored to ServiceNow's tables.

CSDM covers **a lot**, it's not just about service consumption, but also all things related to service value chain, such as capability planning, building services/software, delivering and supporting them.

Having a standard data model to track entities is needed, because ServiceNow is so broad that their own development teams need to have aligned way to develop new functionalities.

And for customers,


# What ServiceNow has wrong in CSDM

Business Service Offering should be for business users but for customers

Technical Service Offering shouldn't be about IT but all internal services

It's all due to ServiceNow's over-relevance in IT, so they have divided it like this.

If they would truly emphasize fred's original vision, IT wouldn't bew so special case.
