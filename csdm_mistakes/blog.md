# What ServiceNow has wrong in CSDM

Business Service Offering should be for business users but for customers

Technical Service Offering shouldn't be about IT but all internal services

It's all due to ServiceNow's over-relevance in IT, so they have divided it like this.

If they would truly emphasize fred's original vision, IT wouldn't bew so special case.
