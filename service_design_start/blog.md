# Keep service Design in mind


We technologicists can get carried away with possibilities of techinical tooling. But we should be focused on achieving added value for our end users.

I am not a service designer, my core-strengths and true passions lie elsewhere. However, I recognize that understanding the basic principles and methods of Service Design helps me create a much better solutions. Therefore I have decided to take a short journey to revisit key concepts in service design. 

## UI alone won't suffice

Rephrase this: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-vs-service-design/  User experience is focused on what the end user encounters, whereas service design is focused on how that user experience is internally created.

A Service is always experienced, and the experience is more than the visuals in the user interface. How does the service experience meet users expectations both in terms of functionalities and service performance.

## Five elements of Service Design

Jesse James Garrett has done a wonderful book about this subject. There five elements of service design were intruduced, and its a great framework to think and work with service design.

From the bottom up:
__Strategy__
__Scope__
__Structure__
__Skeleton__
__Visual Design__

## Fit for the user

In order to achieve to glorified wow-effect, the service needs to be designed with particular user group in mind. If a one-size-fits all service is designed, it can definitely be ok in terms of usage, but exceeding expectations is rare.

## Practical steps

Break user journey to more specific steps, and look for phases in the activity where the user feels uncertain. 

If you think about it, you can recognize many activities in your daily life where service experience could be improved. Fpr example, when you try to use kitchen appliances or shower in a new hotel room, or when you try to remember whether you have paid proper amount of taxes.

## Focus on what you can fix


### Great Tools

#### UI Hierarchy 



#### Service Blueprint

Service Blueprint is a diagram that visualizes relationships between service components that are directly linked to touchpoints of a customer journey.  It often has a form of a matrix, where user activities form the columns, and rows reflect the different layers that need to be in place and working in order to provide the user experience.

First layer, __User Actions__, and it lists the user journey. This is the layer for the UI.

**Line of interaction**

Second layer, __Frontstage Actions__, reflect actions that occur directly in view of a customer. These are often user interactions, and the interaction can happen with a self-service technology or with another user such as an customer service agent.

**Line of visibility**

Third layer, __Backstage Actions__, are user actions that happen behind the scenes and support onstage activities. These actions can be for example service agents checking inventories or consulting colleagues to provide an answer to the end user. 

Fourth layer, __Support Processes__, are internal steps and interactions that support employees delivering the service. This layer includes everything that need need to be in place in order for the higher layers to function.

Note that while designing softwares with high levels of automation, third and fourth layer could be combined to be one layer for the sake of simplicity.

#### Wireframes

If a full draft of the UI is shown to users too early, they get excited about the look and feel, colors etc, and they really can't think about lower layers of the service desgin stack.

__User Journeys__
Define use cases, such as:
* I wan't to see status of my requests


#### Key terminology


Usability = How easy or how suitable user interface is for the user
Accessibility = Ability to access the service, also enabling use of assistive technology for people with disabilities
Heuristic analysis = Study of current service with usability heuristic. ** CHECK EXAMPLES FROM NIELSEN NEUMAN NN TJMS**
Contextual enquiries = Observing users performing their tasks
A/B Testing = Test between two optional choices
UI Design = Design of the UI building blocks and elements
Visual Design = Look of the UI with brand, graphics and images


### Follow Global Design Principles

Note that there exists best practices that you should use. The problem is that there is a myriad of them, and you often need a proper professional to guide you to right direction. However, please know that you should not waste time trying to fight the design principles. When you encounter them, respect them.

In order to read more about design principles, the actual standard to look for is WCAG, but it is __heavy__. Nngroup is a great site with good content and you will most likely find good resources with google.
