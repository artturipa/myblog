# Why I started a blog #
Hurray! First post and the site is live. Let me explain.

## What this blog is
For quite some time I have felt that I should have channel to outlet my thougths. Platforms provided by social media giants have their own drawbacks, and I have always preferred the idea of producing content somewhere where I have power over the context. I also support [indieweb](https://indieweb.org/)-movement. That being said, it's likely that some versions of the writings will be published also in Linkedin, ServiceNow community or company blog. However, this is a personal blog that I write during my sparetime, so the texts here do not represent views of my employer or clients.

## The education and learning
One benefit I seek to achieve via blogging is deeper learning of concepts. I believe an important learning process happens when one focuses to put one's messy thought impulses on paper. That's why whenever I face an interesting problem or challenging concept, I try to formalize my idea into written form. And hopefully by exposing my thinking here, I can receive feedback whenever my thought process behind the idea is insufficient.

Furthermore, writing has always been a challenge for me. I have no trouble communicating my ideas via PowerPoint or bullet points, but somehow prose has always been a challenge. Time to step up!

## For whom
Writing this blog just for myself will be a good enough reason for it to exist. But if by a chance I happen to find an audience, it's only a plus. I like to have discussions and to spread my knowledge, and this can be another channel to do that.

## Topics
I will be writing about ServiceNow, Service Management and IT Architecture. And if I feel the inspiration, I will be also posting about my extracurricular interests, such as books or pastime coding projects. 

For now you can take these writings as my diary of interesting thoughts from a professional realm.
