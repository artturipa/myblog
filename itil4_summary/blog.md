# ITIL4 - what's the fuzz?

During the past decade IT has been transforming to be more business & capability -centric. This transformation has led to many standards and frameworks to renew their content to better reflect the reality of today's practices.

So now, we can leave ITIL3 to the past, may the processes rest in peace, and focus to new and shiny ITIL4. I have decided to partake the certification exam to keep my understanding and credentials fresh. Here are my notes of the content.

## What to remember foremost

The **seven guiding principles** are ‘focus on value’, ‘start where you are’, ‘progress iteratively with feedback’, ‘collaborate and promote visibility’, ‘think and work holistically’, ‘keep it simple and practical’ and ‘optimize and automate’. 

The **four dimensions of service management** are ‘organizations and people’, ‘information and technology’, ‘partners and suppliers’, and ‘value streams and processes’.

The activities of the **service value chain** are ‘plan’, ‘improve’, ‘engage’, ‘design and transition’, ‘obtain/build’, and ‘deliver and support’.

The components of the **service value system** are ‘guiding principles’, ‘governance’, ‘service value chain’, ‘practices’, and ‘continual improvement’.

## Key definitions

* **Value** - perceived benefit

* **Service consumption** - activities performed by service consumer to consume services
* **Service Relationship Model** - Depicts service relationships between organizations, one organisation can be service consumer and via service consumption provide new services to act as service provider.
* **Output** - Tangible or intangible deliverable of an activity
* **Outcome** - Result for a stakeholder enabled by output(s)
* **Costs** - Amount of money spent on an activity or a resource
* **Risk** - Possible event that migth cause harm or loss
* **Utility** - Functionality offered by a product or service
* **Warranty** - Assurance that a product or service meets requirements
* **Service Value System (SVS)** - System that ensures that an organization continually co-creates value. Explains how components and activities of the organisation enable value creation. Holds five components:
    * Guiding Principles
    * Governance
    * Service Value Chain
    * Practices, total of **34**, of which **15** are covered in Foundation
    * Continual Improvement
* **Service Value Chain** - Operating model defining key activities required to respond to demand and enable value creation. Has six activities that turn inputs into outputs:
    * Plan
    * Improve
    * Engage
    * Design and transition
    * Obtain/Build
    * Deliver and support
* **Value Stream** - a series of steps used by organization to create and deliver products and services to service consumers. A combination of value chain activities. **Value chains can contain multiple value streams.**
* **Critical Success Factor (CSF)** - necessary precondition for achieving intended results
* **Management Practice** - set of organizational resources to perform work or accomplish an objective

## Four dimensions of Service Management System
1. **Organizations & People**
    Org. structures, culture, roles, responsibilities, skills...
2. **Information & Technology**
    information, knowledge, technology, relationships between components...
3. **Partners & Suppliers**
    Relationships between organizations being relevant to services, contacts, agreements...
4. **Value streams & processes**
    Activities, workflows, controls, procedures...

These dimensions ensure holistic approach to service management. The dimensions represent perspectives that are relevant to the whole - oranisations should ensure that there is a balance in focus between each dimension.

If organizations focuse only to one area, expected results might be achieved but with loss of work and delays.

## Seven guiding principles of ITIL

The guiding principles:
* Are recommendations to guide organizations
* Support succesful actions and good decisions
* Ensure common understanding and approach
* Are universally applicable

### The principles

1. **Focus on Value**
    Map every action to value.
2. **Start Where You Are**
    Consider what is already available and investigate current state.
3. **Progress iteratively with feedback**
    Do not attempt to do everything at once. Use feedback to ensure correct focus of actions.
4. **Collaborate and promote visibility**
    Cooperate across boundaries to have better buy-in. Work should be visible.
5. **Think and work holistically**
    No service / element stands alone. Outcomes suffer if focus is put into parts and not to the whole.
6. **Keep it simple and practical**
    Eliminate things that do not provide value. Use minimum number of steps to accomplish the objectives.
7. **Optimize and automate**
    Resources and technology should be used to their best effects. Use human intervention only when it brings value.

## ITIL Service Value System(SVS)
SVS ensures that organization continually co-creates value by using and managing products and services.

Service Management works properly only if it works as a system. SVS describes the **input** to this system, the **elements** of the system and the **outputs**.

**Opportunity** and **demand** are key inputs, and the output is **value**.

Components of SVS:
* **Guiding principles**
* **Governance**
* **Service Value Chain**
This model can follow different patterns, and the patterns within the chain are called value streams
* **Practices**
* **Continual Improvement**

SVS describes the value creation in the system and supports many approaches to work. The architecture components of SVS enable flexibility and discourage siloed working.

## Service Value Chain
is a set of activities organization performs to deliver to its customers.
* **Deliver and support** 
Ensuring delivery and support for services as specified
* **Acquire / Build**
Ensuring that services components are available when needed
* **Design and transition** Ensuring that services continually meet their requirements
* **Engage** 
Providing engagement and understanding of stakeholder needs
* **Improve**
Ensuring continual improvement
* **Plan**
Enabling shared understanding of vision, status and direction of services.

## The ITIL Practices
A Practice is a set of organizational resources designed for performing a work or fulfilling an objective. Practices support activities in service value chain and provide a comprehensive toolset for ITSM practitioners.

### General Management Practices

* **Continual Improvement**
Align practices and services with changing business requirements. Continual Improvement can be applied to any type of improvement from high level transformations to changes to CIs.
* **Steps in Continual Improvement Model**
    * What is the vision
    * Where are we now
    * Where do we want to be
    * How do we get there
    * Take action
    * Did we get there
    * How do we keep the momentum going 
    __repeat__
* **Information Security Management**
* **Relationship Management**
* **Supplier Management**

### Service Management Practices

* **IT Asset Management**
* **Monitoring and Event Management**
* **Release Management**
The purpose of the release management practice is to make new and changed services and features available for **use**
* **Service Configuration Management**
Ensure reliable information about configurations of services

* **Change Enablement**
Maximize number of succesful changes by ensuring proper handling of risks and authorizations.

* **Incident Management**

* **Problem Management**

* **Service Desk**
Point of communication capturing the demand for incident resolution and service requests.

* **Service Level Management**
Asses, monitor and manage performance of services.

### Technical Management Practices
* **Deployment Management**
Moving new or changed deployments to live environments.

## Summary of Modules

### Service Management Key Concepts

Organizations can act as a service providers or service consumers, and in reality they often play both roles simultaneously.

Organization's purpose is to create value for stakeholders.

Products are tailored to meet requirements of consumer groups.

Different service offerings can be created to from set of same products, to appeal to different consumer groups.

Service Relationships exists between two or more organizations to co-create value.

Services facilitate outcomes for a customer.

Utility and warranty are important to services. Utility determines 'fit for purpose' and warranty 'fit for use'.
