# What to do as an architect

Architect has been my most common role in customer assignments for the past several years. On most cases my work has been designing basics of the application structure and coaching developers in implementation. It has been also quite common that I take some challenging development tasks for myself when needed.

Recently I started architect position for a large customer that has constantly multiple development initiatives and going on with the instance, and therefore I should reassess how I can scale up my architecture work in a way that would allow multiple ServiceNow vendors to work with the instance without me having to be closely involved. Therefore this is a good time to rethink about what are my success criteria 

## Ensure platform maintanability and flexibility

## Watch out for more junior developers and ensure they get support when needed

## Stay on top of potential security issues

## Be a direct contributor to key development initiatives

## Empower developers to act as independently as possible

## Design implementation when needed

 has partake a new customer, which has more challenges.. I cant keep up with the usual way
