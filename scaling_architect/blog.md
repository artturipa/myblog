# Maximizing Success as an Architect: Strategies and Goals

Architect has been my most common role in client projects for the past several years. My focus has been designing  application artchitecture and mentoring developers in implementation. Occasionally, I have also tackled complex development tasks myself when necessary.

Recently, I started as an architect for a major client that has constantly multiple development initiatives ongoing within the instance. This new assignment encouraged me to reconsider my approach to architect position, as now it is clear that I can't be directly involved in all development initiatives.

and therefore I want to reassess how I as an architect can ensure success in an environment where there are so many developers and development initiatives going on that I can't be directly involved every time.

Hence, here are my revised objectives as an Architect.

## 1. Ensure Platform Maintanability and Flexibility
Ensuring the maintainability and flexibility of the platform is my top priority. As an architect, it's essential to monitor health of the instance and manage technical debt effectively.


## 2. Support Junior Developers
By definition architect's role might not contain development. However, I've realized that often architect needs to act as a lead developer, providing support to less experienced team members. It is undestandable, as the architect is typically the most senior technical expert on the team.

## 3. Stay on Top of Security
If architect won't do this, who will? Security has recently grown in importance. If architect can keep an eye on security issues and provide precise reports to business and security teams, the solution s/he manages is more likely to have a lasting future in the enterprise.

## 4. Contribute to Key Development Initiatives
I might be biased here because I like development, and I don't think I am yet totally ready to give up that part of my job. Usually development is not responsibility of an architect. However, as architect might be most senior technical expert in the team, his/her development contribution can be crucial when new types of development challenges that can't be solved by common developers emerge.

## 5. Enable Developer Independence
Since it's impractical for me to participate in every technical decision, I should focus in enabling developers to make decisions on their own. This requires education about good development practices, and it helps if the team has set of architectural principles to follow. More about that later.

## 6. Design implementation when needed
Translating business requirements into application architecture is another aspect of the architect's role. While the developers I work with are adept at conducting workshops and gathering details, my input is often essential for particularly challenging or extraordinary requirements.

## 7. Elevate Team's Maturity with Development Practices
Currently, some development processes lack proper documentation updates, and the incorporation of automated testing is not a standard practice. I aim to lead by example, encouraging the team to adopt these practices.

## Next steps
I have now started in the position so these are all in progress, let's see what challenges putting these into practice will bring. I will write more detailed insights about these topics further down the road.
