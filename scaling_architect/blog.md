# What to do as an architect

Architect has been my most common role in customer assignments for the past several years. On most cases my work has been designing basics of the application structure and coaching developers in implementation. It has been also quite common that I take some challenging development tasks for myself when needed.

Recently, I started architect position for a large customer that has constantly multiple development initiatives and going on with the instance, and therefore I want to reassess how I as an architect can ensure success in an environment where there are so many developers and development initiatives going on that I can't be directly involved every time.

First, a quick summary on what I would like to achieve

## Ensure platform maintanability and flexibility
To me, this is key priority. Architect should somehow monitor state of the solution and ensure that technical debt keeps in check. 

## Watch out for more junior developers and ensure they get support when needed
Even though architect's work by definition might not involve developments, I have realised that in practice it is common that architect sometimes needs to act as a lead developer as well. It is understandable, as it is common that architect is most senior techinical expert in the team.

## Stay on top of potential security issues
If architect won't do this, who will? This one is a requirement that has recently grown in importance. If architect can keep an eye on security issues and provide precise reports to business and security teams, the solution s/he manages is more likely to have a lasting future in the enterprise.

## Be a direct contributor to key development initiatives
I might be biased here, because I like development and I don't think I am yet totally ready to give up that part of my job. Usually development is not responsibility of an architect. However, as architect might be most senior technical expert in the team, his/her development contribution can be crucial when new types of development challenges that can't be solved by common developers emerge.

## Empower developers to act as independently as possible

## Design implementation when needed

 has partake a new customer, which has more challenges.. I cant keep up with the usual way
